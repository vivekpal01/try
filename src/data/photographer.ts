  heroIntroduction: 'Transforming data into intelligent solutions through Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Data Science.',
  biography: `Passionate about turning data into intelligent solutions, I'm a B.Tech graduate in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence from PCET's Nutan College of Engineering & Research, Pune. With hands-on experience in Python, Machine Learning, and Data Analysis, I bring 1.1 years of ML model development experience and 1.2 years as a Business Analyst in finance.

My technical arsenal includes Python, SQL, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. I've successfully developed ML models for fraud detection, price prediction, and reinforcement learning applications. Certified by IBM in Data Science and Google in Machine Learning, I'm constantly expanding my knowledge through advanced AIML and Web Development courses.`,
  approach: `My approach to AI development is guided by three core principles: Data Quality, Model Optimization, and Real-World Impact. I believe the most powerful AI solutions emerge when we combine rigorous data analysis with innovative algorithms.

Whether working on fraud detection systems or predictive models, I strive to create solutions that not only achieve high accuracy but also provide tangible business value and scalable deployment potential.`,
